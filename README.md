# Introduction 
This is a simple Windows desktop program, HEX to DECIMAL converter.

# Getting Started
The project was created with Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition.
You can use any other environment that can build and debug the code.

# Dependencies
.NET 6.

# Contribute
You are welcome to contribute to the project.
I selected to use a hybrid between the Gitflow workflow and the GitHub workflow.
The default branch is 'develop'. It will be taking all the development merges from feature branches.
The release branch is 'main'. It will be the only release branch for now.
- create you own branch like feature/optionalname-improve-something out of the 'develop'
- improve the code or fix an issue (provide description of the change)
- submit a Pull Request towards the 'develop' branch.
I will review the change and bring it to the 'develop' branch.
