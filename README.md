# Introduction 
This is a simple Windows app, HEX to DECIMAL converter. It fills the UX gap between the existing tools I came across so far.

# Getting Started
Now, at the inception of this project I am using Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition. You can use any other environment that can build and debug the code.

# Dependencies
Nothing except .NET 6.

# Contribute
You are welcome to contribute to the project. I selected to use a hybrid between the Gitflow workflow and the GitHub workflow, which means that the pull requests will be coming from feature branches to the develop branch. But the main branch and the release branches will come to the play only if/when we have multiple versions. Therefore:
- create you own branch like feature/optionalname-improve-something out of the develop
- improve the code or fix an issue (untracked so far - a description is sufficient)
- submit a Pull Request towards the develop branch
- I will review the change and bring it to the develop codeline. Please understand that I might not check this repository for a few weeks. But eventually, I will come to it.
